Implementation of the LSTM model for Sentiment Analysis

Recurrent neural networks are a form of Artificial Neural networks that can memorize arbitrary-length sequences of input patterns by capturing connections between sequential data types. However, due to stochastic gradientsâ€™ failure, RNNs are unable to detect long-term dependencies in lengthy sequences. 
Several novel RNN models, notably LSTM, were proposed to address this issue. LSTM networks are RNN extensions designed to learn sequential data and their long-term connections more precisely than standard RNNs. 
Sentiment analysis is a potent tool with varied applications across industries. It is helpful for social media and brand monitoring, customer support and feedback analysis, market research, etc. As sentiment analysis grows more and more useful in the industry, it becomes essential for us to learn how to perform it.
